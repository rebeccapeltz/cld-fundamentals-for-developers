## Launch Server
You can use any HTTP server to launch this example, here are a few suggestions:

* `npx http-server .` (Node.js)
* `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (Python)
* `python3 -m http.server` (Python)
* Install [live-server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) plug-in if you use Visual Studio Code

Any of the above options would work. Once the HTTP server is running, open your browser and go to with the created URL. If you're using **live-server**, right click on the index.html and choose `Open with Live Server`
